					<h3>how it works</h3>
                    <p2>Organic agriculture, which is governed by strict government standards, requires that products bearing the organic label are produced without the use of toxic and persistent pesticides and synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, antibiotics, synthetic hormones, genetic engineering or other excluded practices, sewage sludge, or irradiation.

                                Organic farming practices reduce pollution, conserve water, reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy, is also better for birds

                                Today, at our second-generation family farm, we keep with our parents vision by practicing healthy crop rotation, encouraging a diverse ecosystem around the fields, efficiently using local water sources and carefully selecting produce varieties that grow well and taste great.

                                    The idea that happier farm animals produce higher quality food is not new, and it seems to be catching on. Several small scale egg farmers have transitioned to a “pastured” system, allowing their chickens to roam freely to eat grass and bugs the way nature intended. These chickens are not simply “free range” or “cage free,” which are terms that unfortunately dont have much meaning in todays food market
